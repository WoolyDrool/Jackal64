Foxspur 2.0 Design Changes

- No survival mechanics
- Simplified inventory (Non-grid based)
- Trash is scored as a value similar to DRG ores
- More emphasis on in-world cleaning mini games/challenges
- Smaller more tightly designed levels (campsites, rec areas etc)
- Reduced scope overall
- Trash is now divided up between recycling and non and deposit methods / rewards are different for each
with penalties for incorrect depositing

Minigame Ideas
- Gate unlocking
- Wiping off grime
- Putting objects in a bag
- Tying trash bag
- Can crushing
- Chopping firewood


Misc Ideas
- Minigame hard mode option. Makes minigames require more accurate mouse movements or faster response
- Night trails. As kind of a re-introduction of the games initial premise, there could be trails that are always at night and feature
harder objectives and maybe minor horror elements
